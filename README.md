etch-a-sketch
=============
An etch-a-sketch project created as part of the Odin Project.  It uses JavaScript/JQuery to create a sketchpad grid.  I made this before I knew much about HTML5 Canvas, so the drawing board is made using HTML <div>s to create the pixels.  This was the first proper project I made and quite a challenge at the time!
